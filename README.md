### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |

|**Program prompts user to enter a sentence**|
| **Program recognizes when user enters a sentence**| Input: "Kittytopia is the best place to see kitties and find your kitty best friend!" | Output: "Kittytopia is the best place to see kitties and find your kitty best friend!"|
|**I selected this input value because the program has to have a sentence to check to run, check for multiple occurrence, and that the word isn't counted within other words**|

| **Program recognizes when user enters a word and checks the sentence entered for occurrence** | User input: "kitty" | Output: "Your word appears 1 time" |
